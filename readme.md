  Subject: Urgent: Report of Unfortunate Incident and Safety Concerns

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to report a distressing incident that occurred yesterday (on 04 Friday evening) during my commute in cab 7852.

The incident involved the driver refusing to drop me at my usual point, AutoNagar, stating that it is listed as Hayath Nagar in the system. It came to my attention that he was reprimanded due to a previous complaint I filed against him. As a result, he attempted to retaliate by denying me the drop.

After the driver contacted someone from your team and received confirmation, he eventually dropped me at my usual point. While I appreciate the swift resolution, I am deeply concerned about the safety and privacy of passengers when their complaint information is shared with the drivers.

I have been using the same route for the past 10-15 days, and this driver has never reached out to anyone during that time. Some of my colleagues who have previously ridden with him have also mentioned that they are hesitant to ask him to contact them for a smooth transit experience.

My primary concerns are:

1. Safety: Are background checks conducted regularly on the drivers to ensure passenger safety?
2. Privacy: How can we be assured that our complaint information is handled with utmost confidentiality and not used against us by drivers?

I want to acknowledge that not all drivers are the same, and some have been incredibly helpful. For instance, on Jul 18th, driver Mallesh-5116 promptly assisted two of us when there was a communication glitch regarding the assigned cab.

In light of the recent incident and for smoother operations, I kindly request the consideration of adding a nodal point at Auto Nagar. This point has been widely used by many passengers, including myself, for nearly a year and has proven to be convenient for commuters.

I believe addressing these issues will enhance passenger safety, privacy, and overall satisfaction with your service. Your prompt attention and action in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response and assurance of enhanced safety measures.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
